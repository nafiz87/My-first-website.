                This is Ghost of tsushima, one of my favorite game. It's a ps4 exclusive and you have to pay $60 to play it. It's a game about a samurai who fights the mongols when they attacked tsushima island.

                Minecraft is also one of my favorite game. It's a all platform game with various types of gameplay. Everyone can enjoy this open world game. And It's cheap too.

                My all time favorite game is GTA V. Rockstar who made games like gta sa, gta vice city, red dead redemption made this game. This is an open world game with all types of functionality. It's a absolute masterpiece and I like this game very much.
